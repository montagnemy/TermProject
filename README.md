Exploring Montreal's Mural Distribution

Montreal has long been known as an arts city. In recent decades the city has been increasing funding for subsidized murals distributed around the city and commissioned by local and international artists. This Project attempts to visualize this distribution in an interactive map which displays the most relevant info of the mural so that interested viewers can get a quick sample of which they might want to go visit. The map also contains layers which reveal some socioeconomic info that we can make conclusions about in reference to Mural distribution.
